"""Chapter 2: connections, the practice workspace and safe mode.

No lesson needs an account. The practice workspace is the default, and
connecting a real account is optional. When one is connected, credentials pass
through to the gateway and nowhere else: the harness does not keep, log or
return them, and the gateway stores them in a local file that only the owner
can read.
