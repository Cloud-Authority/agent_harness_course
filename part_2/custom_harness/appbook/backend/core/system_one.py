"""System One: a small model that decides, beside the model that reasons.

Claude reasons, plans and writes. Before Claude is asked anything, the harness
has decisions to make that need meaning and have a closed set of answers: is
this email an attack, which evidence is worth reading, which procedure applies,
which tools does the request need. A System One model answers such a question
with a probability. It writes no text and it takes no action. This appbook uses
Jev, from Typesafe.

Three rules hold for every call.

* **The harness owns the threshold.** System One returns a number. A rule in
  this file turns the number into a decision.
* **Every caller has a fallback.** Without ``TYPESAFE_API_KEY``, or when the
  service cannot be reached, ``decide`` returns ``None`` and the harness decides
  by rule, as it did before.
* **Every call is logged.** ``PPA_DECISION_LOG`` keeps the kind of decision, the
  number of questions, the time it took and the tokens it cost.

Text that is judged is sent to Typesafe. With the practice workspace that text
is public mail. With a real account it is the owner's mail, and the Connections
chapter says so.
